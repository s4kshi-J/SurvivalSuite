SurvivalSuite is an interactive survival analysis dashboard built with synthetic life insurance data.

## features
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by demographic/policy variables
- Cox Proportional Hazards regression
- Downloadable filtered dataset and model summary
- Interactive filters with live charts
